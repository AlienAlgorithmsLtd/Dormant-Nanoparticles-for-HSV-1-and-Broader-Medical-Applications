# Dormant-Nanoparticles-for-HSV-1-and-Broader-Medical-Applications
This project focuses on the development of dormant nanoparticles that activate in response to specific biochemical signals, such as those associated with the reactivation of HSV-1 or the presence of disease markers in cancer. These nanoparticles deliver targeted therapies to neutralize viruses or target diseased cells before symptoms appear.
